# JavaScript/WASM Binding

npm package name: `nirs4all`

The canonical source repository is `nirs4all-core`; the npm publication uses
the bare `nirs4all` name as the JavaScript/WASM aggregate surface. Python alone
uses the `nirs4all-core` distribution name to avoid colliding with the full
modelling library.

This package is the runtime surface that `nirs4all-web` should consume. The web
application lives in `nirs4all-web`; this directory is for the reusable
JavaScript/WASM binding and package metadata.

The portable execution API delegates Kennard-Stone, SNV, Savitzky-Golay, and
PLS component sweeps to `@nirs4all/methods`:

- `runPortablePipeline(source, dataset)` parses the shared nirs4all JSON/YAML
  syntax, executes the portable subset, and returns parity-checkable split,
  target, variant, and selected-result fields plus a serialized selected PLS
  model.
- `predictPortablePipeline(result, dataset)` replays the recorded preprocessing
  chain and predicts with that serialized model through the same methods WASM
  backend.

Savitzky-Golay defaults to `mode: "interp"` for full nirs4all parity and
preserves explicit methods-backed modes (`mirror`, `constant`, `nearest`,
`wrap`, `interp`) plus `cval` in the serialized preprocessing chain.

Custom app hosts can inspect `capabilityManifest()`, `controllerCapabilities`,
`runtimeSurfaces`, and `runtimeContracts` before rendering graph nodes or
selecting a runtime. The manifest schema is `nirs4all-core.capabilities.v1`; it
exposes the stable V1 controller IDs for Kennard-Stone, SNV, Savitzky-Golay,
PLS regression, and the portable methods pipeline, with parameter lists
matching the executable parser. `runtimeContracts` also makes explicit that
standalone serialized-model prediction is currently a WASM-only contract.

For a browser-only custom host, pair this package with `nirs4all-ui`: keep
runtime loading and portable execution in `nirs4all`, and consume shared React
components / view-model helpers / brand assets from `nirs4all-ui`. The
reference composition lives in the `nirs4all-web` browser app, whose contract
tests exercise `runPortablePipeline()` / `predictPortablePipeline()` together
with the shared UI package in a no-backend environment.
