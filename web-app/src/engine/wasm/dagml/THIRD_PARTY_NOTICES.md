# Third-Party Notices — dag-ml

`dag-ml` is distributed under `CeCILL-2.1 OR AGPL-3.0-or-later`. It does **not** vendor the
components below — they are pulled from their official distributions — but their licenses are
acknowledged here as a courtesy and for compliance. Licenses are reported on a best-effort basis;
the authoritative text always ships with each upstream project.
